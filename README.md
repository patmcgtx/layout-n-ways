# layout-n-ways 𝌛
Sample iOS UI layouts a few different ways (SwiftUI, UIKit storyboartds, UIKit in code).

I'll pick a few iOS apps and figure out how to do that kind of layout on my own using different approaches to expand my perspective and to sharpen my skills.

## Motivation 💡

Ahh, the real world.  Most of the time on big iOS projects at work, I have to jump into whatever code existed before me.  It's usually messy, and there's usually a hurrty to get it done.

Maybe it's a [storyboard](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Conceptual/Devpedia-CocoaApp/Storyboard.html) with [Auto Layout](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/AutolayoutPG/index.html).  Maybe the storyboard is 5 years old and was stitched together by nine different developers who may or may not have ever talked to each other and are no longer with the company.  My job is often to just stitch on a new feature or fix a bug and move on to the next challenge. ➡

Maybe I'm jumping into a project that is a month old, and I need to work with two other developers to finish the feature as soon as possible.  The new feature is [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/), and it needs to integrate with a UIKit to fit into the rest of the app. ⎄

Usually I have to learn on the fly.  Why are we getting an ambigious constraint error?  Could this be a content hugging issue? 🤗  Or is it compression resistence? ⇥ Did it work in the old OS and break in the new one?  Do I need to rethink the whole layout to make this new feature work?

This is most of my professional day.  It is a rare case to create a brand new, clean UI from scratch.  And we only work in so many different kinds of views.  And the UX team is overloaded or on loan from the web, so the design isnt always top-notch mobile.

This project is my chance to expand my horizons.

I am going to figure out how to implement the UI for some top iOS apps, mostly standards made by  such as Mail, Messages, Phone, Podcasts, News, Calendar 😮, Photos 😵‍💫, Maps 😱.  And I'm going to do each app a couple of different ways (SwiftUI, UIKit with storyoards, maye even UIKit in code) to gain perspective and because the world is still very much in a mixed SwiftUI/UIKit mode.

With me luck. 🍀  This is going to be a long-running, ever-developing project.
